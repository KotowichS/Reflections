When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Having group projects in a lot of my classes, using a remote respository will be extremely helpful!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually pulling allows the user the option of when to retrieve the data from github.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch is created when you commit a change that you do not want to affect the master branch. This allows you to make experimental
changes without affecting the already working code. A clone allows you to copy a repository from github to your computer. This should be
used when you are using your own code. A Fork is used to copy another person's repository to your own github while allowing the original
creators to retain credit for the original coce, but also allowing you to make changes and potentially suggest changes to the original code!

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is that you can see what changes you are making compared
to the previous version.
