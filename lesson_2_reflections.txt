What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a git repository it creates a hidden file '.git'. Now you need to create a commit for the new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the preamble to committing files to the repository. The working directory  is the directory that you are currently
using. The staging area is helpful in connecting multiple files into one commit.
