When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Having group projects in a lot of my classes, using a remote respository will be extremely helpful!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually pulling allows the user the option of when to retrieve the data from github.
